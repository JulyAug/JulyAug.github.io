  Welcome to the Notes section. Below, you'll find mind maps I made for undergraduate-level 
  Mathematical Analysis and Stochastic Process. These two courses share the same characteristics:
  they have A LOT OF theorems, lemmas, etc. When I was studying them, I also felt very burdened by these courses
  at first glance. So, I decided to make these mind maps that significantly helped me to comprehend 
  and remember the structure and logic within the chapters and, very importantly, the "storyline" for the 
  whole book (i.e. why the authors organized the chapters in the specific sequence).<br>
  <br>
  When making the mind maps, I kept asking myself two questions:<br>
  1. If I'm the lecturer, how would I organize my lecture notes and handouts to help the students quickly understand?<br>
  2. If I'm the lecturer, which theorem(s)/proof of theorem(s)/application of theorem(s) should I test the students? Why?<br>

  <br>
  These questions pushed me to fully understand the material's structure while making mind maps, and these maps 
  helped me succeed in exams. So, I post them out, hoping to help more students struggling with these topics.

  Sorry for non-Chinese speakers that some Chinese annotations(not so much) were included because I tought I would be able to better comprehend the concepts
  by using my mother language.
