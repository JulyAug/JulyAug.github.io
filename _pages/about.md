I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics with a specialization in Statistics and Data Science at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). I'm expected to graduate in June 2025. Feel free to contact me at: dc12569@um.edu.mo

<span style="color: #FF7F50;">&#10022; Applying for PhD in Statistics &#10022;</span>
======
I'm applying for Statistics PhD programs starting in the Fall of 2025. <br>

My love for the elegance of rigorous analysis makes me currently interested in Mathematical Statistics, especially in advancing the theoretical foundations of High-Dimensional, Robust, and Nonparametric Statistics. I hope to overcome some of the current limitations in statistical inferences through theoretical advancement. Since I also have a solid background in Computer Science and Data Science, I can also handle tasks in applied statistics. I look forward to adapting and refining my interests to align with my future advisorâ€™s research focus and contribute to ongoing projects. <br>
                                                                  
***Adaptation + Strong Independent-learning Ability (See "Research" and "Note") + Motivation (Career Goal) ==  A Good Potential PhD Student***

Career Goal
======
My career goal has always been, and possibly will always be, entering academia. I'm working har to become a qualified college professor in Statistics. This dream job can combine my love for statistics with my desire to share what I have learned and found with others. 

I'm attracted by statistics as it is a field that blends mathematical rigor with interdisciplinary applications. It is also a young and rapidly evolving discipline driven by the demands of this information age. This dynamic nature underscores the need for educators who are not only well-versed in current advancements but also capable of anticipating future trends. I aspire to be such an educator, one who bridges cutting-edge research with effective teaching methods. To achieve this, I need to deepen my expertise through advanced study under the guidance of experienced professors and active involvement in rigorous research. This is one of the key reasons why I'm pursuing PhD studies.  

I'm keen to build and practice my teaching skills through being a teaching assistant in my PhD study. Upon completing PhD, my goal is to be capable of conveying information understandably to the targeted audience. This goal may sound simple, but it involves many tasks like speaking while noticing the students' responses, knowing the hard points for most students, writing structured lecture notes and handouts, organizing supportive TA lessons, etc. I believe the capability of conveying is the first step toward a qualified lecturer.

After stepping on the first ladder, I'm going to strive to let my students feel my enthusiasm for the subject and to teach my students not just statistics itself but also the way of building their learning systems, which I believe is the most important for their later on studies and careers. My ultimate hope is that when students leave my classroom, they'll tell their friends, "Statistics isn't as hard as I thought," or "I hope to find a field I'm passionate about one day, just like Professor Zhu."
