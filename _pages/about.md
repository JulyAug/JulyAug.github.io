I'm a Math major fourth-year undergraduate student specializing in Statistics and Data Science at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). I'm expected to graduate in June 2025. Feel free to contact me at: dc12569@um.edu.mo

======
I'm applying for PhD in Statistics and related fields starting in the Fall of 2025. <br>

My current research interests include statistical learning, computational statistics, inferential statistics (especially for fiducial inference), and nonparametric statistics. I look forward to adapting and refining my interests to align with my future advisorâ€™s research focus and contribute to ongoing projects. <br>
                                                                  
***Adaptation + Strong Independent-learning Ability (See "Research" and "Note") + Motivation (Career Goal) ==  A Good Potential PhD Student***

Career Goal
======
My goal is to pursue a career as a university professor. This dream job can combine my love for discovering new things with my desire to share what I have learned and found with others. 

I'm keen to build and practice my teaching skills through being a teaching assistant in my PhD study. Upon completing PhD, my goal is to be capable of conveying information understandably to the targeted audience. This goal may sound simple, but it involves many tasks like speaking while noticing the students' responses, knowing the hard points for most students, writing structured lecture notes and handouts, organizing supportive TA lessons, etc. I believe the capability of conveying is the first step toward a qualified lecturer.

After stepping on the first ladder, I'm going to strive to let my students feel my enthusiasm for the subject and to teach my students not just statistics itself but also the way of building their learning systems, which I believe is the most important for their later on studies and careers. My ultimate hope is that when students leave my classroom, they'll say to their friends, "Statistics isn't as hard as I thought," or "I hope to find a field I'm passionate about one day, just like Professor Zhu."
