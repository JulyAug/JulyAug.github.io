I'm a Math major fourth-year undergraduate student specilizing in Statistics and Data Science at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). I'm expected to graduate in June 2025. Feel free to contact me at: dc12569@um.edu.mo

======
I'm applying for PhD in Statistics/Statistics and Operational Research/Statistical Science/Biostatistics starting in the Fall of 2025. <br>

I have an eclectic range of research interests across multiple areas of statistics. Whether engaging with abstract theoretical statistics or working on tangible, interdisciplinary statistical problems, I find each area intriguing and exciting. Because of this diverse interest, I am highly adaptable and open to engaging with a wide range of research problems. <br>

Career Goal
======
My goal is to pursue a career as a college professor. I always think I'm very lucky to find that there is a job that can combine my love for discovering new things and my desire to share what I have learned with others. 

I'm keen to build and practice my teaching skills through being a teaching assistant in my PhD study. Upon completing PhD, my goal is to be capable of conveying information understandably to the targeted audience. This goal may sound simple, but I know it involves many tasks like speaking while noticing the students' responses, knowing the hard points for most students, writing structured lecture notes and handouts, organizing supportive TA lessons, etc. I believe the capability of conveying is the first step toward a qualified college teacher.

After stepping on the first ladder, I'm going to strive to let my students feel my enthusiasm for the subject and to teach my students not just the materials of the course but also the way of building their learning systems, which I believe is the most important for their later on studies and careers. My ultimate hope is that when students leave my classroom, they'll say to their friends, "Statistics isn't as hard as I thought," or "I hope to find a field I'm passionate about one day, just like Professor Zhu."
