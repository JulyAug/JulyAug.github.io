**Xiaoyang Zhu** and Changying Hu (Submitted for Review). A Mathematical Guidance on Strategies for River Water Pollution Management Using Ordinary Differential Equations. 

Abstract and Highlights
------
Here is the [abstract](/images/Abstract.png).

**Highlights**
* Two Ordinary Differential Equation models are developed to enhance informed river pollution management strategies.
* The recovery time model estimates the time required to restore river quality under varying pollution levels.
* The antidegradation model calculates the antidegradation scalars after water quality recovery.
* A Python program is provided for policymakers to easily implement models.


Contributions
------
* Identified the antidegradation problem in river water treatment and developed the Antidegradation Model.
* Developed a user-friendly Python program that allows policymakers to implement the two ODE models.
* Wrote the original draft of the research article.
* Drew the graphical abstract and created all the charts used to explain models and strategies.
* Formated the article in Latex and took charge of the submission process.
