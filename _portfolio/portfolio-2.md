Motivation:
------
* Kidney diseases are often difficult to diagnose at an early stage, which is when treatment can be more effective. When kidney disease is diagnosed at a terminal stage, treatment options may be limited, with kidney transplantation being one of the few viable options. Therefore, it is important to study how to diagnose kidney diseases in their early stages.

What Iâ€™ve Done:
------
* Reviewed a few recent highly cited articles about using Machine Learning Models to identify and classify human diseases.
  * Made a [mind map](/files/Summary.pdf) to summarize the essentials in the papers. (Sorry that some Chinese characters were included because we were communicating in Chinese.)

* Independently studied the theory behind some feature selection techniques and unsupervised learning models through YouTube tutorials, with a particular focus on understanding the rationale for selecting specific techniques and models based on the problem at hand.
  * Implemented sample code from the tutorials and analyzed the purpose of each step to fully understand the processes.

* Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection and used K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to identify potential groups of kidney diseases from urine samples. Compared the performance of both models, Hierarchical Clustering performed better for this case.
