Motivation
------
A research group in the Math Department at the University of Macau collaborated with a local hospital to develop a VR hospital. The group aimed to assess the performance of affordable 3D scanners, such as those integrated into iPhones and iPads, for scanning delicate medical equipment. To support this initiative, they brought me on, along with several other undergraduate students, to test these scanners in a lab setting. Our objective was to scan and reconstruct the lab environment as realistically as possible.

What Iâ€™ve Done:
------
* Scanned the laboratory environment and furniture, identified and classified scanning flaws, and designed solutions for each issue.
  * For repairable flaws, refined the scans using Blender.
  * For flaws that were difficult to repair, identified the causes and rescanned the furniture.
    * An example of a non-repairable scanning flaw:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src='/images/Scan_flaw.png' style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
</div>

* Designed and conducted experiments to determine the causes of scanning flaws and explored methods to mitigate them.
  * Experimented with various scanning environments, including:
     * Natural Lighting: Sunny morning/noon/afternoon/evening
     * Natural Lighting: Cloudy morning/noon/afternoon/evening
     * Artificial Lighting: Double Light Sources--light bulb/light bulb+reflector
  * Found out that normal 3D scanners at the back of iPhones and iPads performed best in natural lighting during cloudy noons and afternoons, as the even distribution of natural light, especially on metal surfaces, improved scanning accuracy.
    * An example of a chair scanned in a cloudy afternoon:
    <div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src='/images/Chair.png' style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></div>

* Successfully used cost-effective scanning tools to achieve results comparable to more expensive, professional equipment.
