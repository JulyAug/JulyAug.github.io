title: "Mind Maps for Stochastic Processes"
collection: teaching
---

I used the textbook "_Basic Stochastic Processes: A Course Through Exercises_" written by Zdzisław Brzeźniak and Tomasz Zastawniak. My mind maps contain many screenshots from the book and the lecture notes made by Prof. Ding, Deng from the University of Macau.

_Stochastic Processes_ was a course that I really enjoyed in the first semester of year 3. I enjoyed the process of struggling to understand the abstract concepts and interpreting them using my own words. You may also find some "cartoons" I drew while I was in the process of learning to enhance my understanding.(Like [this one](/images/Cartoon.png))

Upon learning _Stochastic Processes_, I found it contributes greatly to studying _Time Series_ and many statistics courses. And I hope my mind maps can assist other undergraduates in learning this subject.
