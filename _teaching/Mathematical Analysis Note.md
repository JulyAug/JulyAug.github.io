title: "Mind Maps for Mathematical Analysis"
collection: teaching
---

I used the textbook "_Introduction to Real Analysis: Fourth Edition_" written by Robert G. Bartle and Donald R. Sherbert. My mind maps contain many screenshots from the book and the lecture notes made by Prof. Hu, Guanghui from the University of Macau. Also, some of the proof steps were offerd by the course [18.100A Real Analysis from MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/). Dr. Casey Rodriguez was the lecturer of the course. I independently studied the course as a preview to the Mathematical Analysis course at school.

_Mathematical Analysis_ took up most of my time in second-year undergraduate study. This course meant a lot for my math study because it marked the completion of my learning system construction. Starting from my freshman days of learning linear algebra and calculus, I used 1.5 years to build the system and 0.5 years to test and refine it. If you go through the mind maps from Chapter 2 to Chapter 10, you can see my improvements in organizing the logic and the structure of the material that happened in 10 months.

I'm very thankful to Prof. Hu, Guanghui, who supportively taught me in class, and Dr. Casey Rodriguez whose lecture videos helped me a lot in the preview processes. Also, many thanks to [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/). I didn't even dare to imagine that I could enjoy the lecture and lecture materials from MIT one day.
